# Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for processing Italian PDFs, extracting text, and preparing data for GraphDB/Neo4j integration. Licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

## 📦 Data Layer

### 🚛 Data Ingestion

- [**file_classifier.py**](./src/ingestion/file_classifier.py): Classifies PDFs as text-based or image-based using `pdfplumber` and saves the result as metadata for later usage.
- [**text_ingestor.py**](./src/ingestion/text_ingestor.py): Extracts text from files using `pdfplumber` (text-based), `Tesseract OCR` (image-based, `lang="ita"`), and `PyMuPDF` (images).
- [**text_cleaner.py**](./src/ingestion/text_cleaner.py): Cleans the extracted text.
- [**text_chunker.py**](./src/ingestion/text_chunker.py): Splits cleaned text into sentence-based chunks.

### 🛠️ Data Transformation
- [**sentence_transformer.py**](./src.embeddings.sentence_transformer.py): Generates embeddings from sentence chunks.

### 🗄️ Data Management
- [**vector_store.py**](./src.data.vector_store.py): Stores generated embeddings into a vector database, e.g., Milvus.

## 📝 Logging

Proper code is embedded in each script and execution logs for each is saved to `logs/` for debugging.

## 🚀 How to Run the Scripts in the Repository

Each script in this project is designed to be run as a module using Python's `-m` flag from the root directory of the repository. This ensures proper handling of relative imports in our modular codebase. An example is mentioned below:

```
python -m src.ingestion.text_ingestor
```
Replace the above mentioned script path with your desired path.
